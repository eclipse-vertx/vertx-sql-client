== Using transactions

=== Transactions with connections

You can execute transaction using SQL `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`, if you do so you must use
a {@link io.vertx.sqlclient.SqlConnection} and manage it yourself.

Or you can use the transaction API of {@link io.vertx.sqlclient.SqlConnection}:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#transaction01(io.vertx.sqlclient.Pool)}
----

When the database server reports the current transaction is failed (e.g the infamous _current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
end of transaction block_), the transaction is rollbacked and the {@link io.vertx.sqlclient.Transaction#abortHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)}
is called:

{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#transaction02(io.vertx.sqlclient.Transaction)}

=== Simplified transaction API

When you use a pool, you can call {@link io.vertx.sqlclient.Pool#withTransaction} to pass it a function executed
within a transaction.

It borrows a connection from the pool, begins the transaction and calls the function with a client executing all
operations in the scope of this transaction.

The function must return a future of an arbitrary result:

- when the future succeeds the client will commit the transaction
- when the future fails the client will rollback the transaction

After the transaction completes, the connection is returned to the pool and the overall result is provided.
