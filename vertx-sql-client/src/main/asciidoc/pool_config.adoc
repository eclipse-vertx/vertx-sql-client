=== Server load balancing

You can configure the pool with a list of servers instead of a single server.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#poolConfig01}
----

The pool uses a round-robin load balancing when a connection is created to select different servers.

NOTE: this provides load balancing when the connection is created and not when the connection is borrowed from the pool.

=== Pool connection initialization

You can use the {@link io.vertx.sqlclient.Pool#connectHandler} to interact with a connection after it
has been created and before it is inserted in the pool.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#poolConfig02}
----

Once you are done with the connection, you should simply close it to signal the pool to use it.
