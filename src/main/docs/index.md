# Reactive Postgres Client

The Reactive Postgres Client is a client for Postgres with a straightforward API focusing on
scalability and low overhead.

The client is reactive and non blocking, allowing to handle many database connections with a single thread.

* Event driven
* Lightweight
* Built-in connection pooling
* Prepared queries caching
* Publish / subscribe using Postgres `NOTIFY/LISTEN`
* Batch and cursor support
* Row streaming
* Command pipeling
* RxJava 1 and RxJava 2 support
* Direct memory to object without unnecessary copies
* Java 8 Date and Time support
* SSL/TLS support
* HTTP/1.x CONNECT, SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 proxy support

## Usage

To use the Reactive Postgres Client add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs#"+attributes"]
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>${maven.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${maven.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile '${maven.groupId}:${maven.artifactId}:${maven.version}'
}
```

## Getting started

Here is the simplest way to connect, query and disconnect

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#gettingStarted()}
```

You can also use environment variables to set default connection setting values, this is useful
when you want to avoid hard-coding database connection information. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) for more details. 
The following parameters are supported:

* `PGHOST`
* `PGHOSTADDR`
* `PGPORT`
* `PGDATABASE`
* `PGUSER`
* `PGPASSWORD`

## Connecting to Postgres

Most of the time you will use a pool to connect to Postgres:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#connecting01}
```

The pooled client uses a connection pool and any operation will borrow a connection from the pool
to execute the operation and release it to the pool.

If you are running with Vert.x you can pass it your Vertx instance:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#connecting02}
```

You need to release the pool when you don't need it anymore:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#connecting03}
```

When you need to execute several operations on the same connection, you need to use a client
{@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection connection}.

You can easily get one from the pool:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#connecting04}
```

Once you are done with the connection you must close it to release it to the pool, so it can be reused.

## Running queries

When you don't need a transaction or run single queries, you can run queries directly on the pool; the pool
will use one of its connection to run the query and return the result to you.

Here is how to run simple queries:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries01(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient)}
```

You can do the same with prepared queries.

The SQL string can refer to parameters by position, using `$1`, `$2`, etc…​

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries02(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient)}
```

Query methods provides an asynchronous {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgResult} instance that works for _SELECT_ queries

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries03(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient)}
```

or _UPDATE_/_INSERT_ queries:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries04(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient)}
```

The {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.Row} gives you access to your data by index

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries05(Row)}
```

or by name

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries06(Row)}
```

You can access a wide variety of of types

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries07(Row)}
```

You can execute prepared batch

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries08(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient)}
```

You can cache prepared queries:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#queries09(io.vertx.core.Vertx, PgPoolOptions)}
```

## Using connections

When you need to execute sequential queries (without a transaction), you can create a new connection
or borrow one from the pool:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections01(io.vertx.core.Vertx, io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgPool)}
```

Prepared queries can be created:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections02(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

NOTE: prepared query caching depends on the {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnectOptions#setCachePreparedStatements(boolean)} and
does not depend on whether you are creating prepared queries or use {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgClient#preparedQuery(java.lang.String, io.vertx.core.Handler) direct prepared queries}

By default prepared query executions fetch all results, you can use a {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgCursor} to control the amount of rows you want to read:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections03(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

Cursors shall be closed when they are released prematurely:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections04(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

A stream API is also available for cursors, which can be more convenient, specially with the Rxified version.

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections05(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

The stream read the rows by batch of `50` and stream them, when the rows have been passed to the handler,
a new batch of `50` is read and so on.

The stream can be resumed or paused, the loaded rows will remain in memory until they are delivered and the cursor
will stop iterating.

{@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgPreparedQuery} can perform efficient batching:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#usingConnections06(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

## Using transactions

You can execute transaction using SQL `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`, if you do so you must use
a {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection} and manage it yourself.

Or you can use the transaction API of {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection}:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#transaction01(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgPool)}
```

When Postgres reports the current transaction is failed (e.g the infamous _current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
end of transaction block_), the transaction is rollbacked and the {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgTransaction#abortHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)}
is called:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#transaction02(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgPool)}
```

## Postgres type mapping

### Handling JSON

The {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.Json} Java type is used to represent the Postgres `JSON` and `JSONB` type.

The main reason of this type is handling `null` JSON values.

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#jsonExample()}
```

### Handling NUMERIC

The {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.Numeric} Java type is used to represent the Postgres `NUMERIC` type.

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#numericExample(Row)}
```

## Pub/sub

Postgres supports pub/sub communication channels.

You can set a {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection#notificationHandler(io.vertx.core.Handler)} to receive
Postgres notifications:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#pubsub01(io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnection)}
```

The {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.pubsub.PgSubscriber} is a channel manager managing a single connection that
provides per channel subscription:

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#pubsub02(io.vertx.core.Vertx)}
```

You can provide a reconnect policy as a function that takes the number of `retries` as argument and returns an `amountOfTime`
value:

* when `amountOfTime < 0`: the subscriber is closed and there is no retry
* when `amountOfTime ## 0`: the subscriber retries to connect immediately
* when `amountOfTime > 0`: the subscriber retries after `amountOfTime` milliseconds

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#pubsub03(io.vertx.core.Vertx)}
```

The default policy is to not reconnect.

## Using SSL/TLS

To configure the client to use SSL connection, you can configure the {@link io.reactiverse.pgclient.PgConnectOptions}
like a Vert.x `NetClient`}.

```$lang
{@link examples.Examples#ex10}
```

More information can be found in the [Vert.x documentation](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#ssl).

## Using a proxy

You can also configure the client to use an HTTP/1.x CONNECT, SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 proxy.

More information can be found in the [Vert.x documentation](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_using_a_proxy_for_client_connections).
